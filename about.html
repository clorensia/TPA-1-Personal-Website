            About [Your Name]
(I also go by [Nickname] sometimes.)

I love building with data and crafting the technology that brings insights to life. I am currently sharpening my skills on both ends of the stack, pursuing my degree in Data Science while immersing myself in a rigorous full-stack development bootcamp.

My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, data wrangling, and machine learning. I thrive on the challenge of finding patterns and stories hidden within complex datasets. But I believe an insight is only as powerful as its application. That's why I'm building the engineering muscle to not only understand what the data says but to build the elegant, scalable applications that make that understanding accessible and useful.

I am passionate about the entire pipelineâ€”from the Python notebooks and SQL queries that power the analysis to the React components and API endpoints that create a tangible user experience. My goal is to become a versatile builder who can own a project from a data hypothesis all the way to a deployed product.

I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply this unique blend of analytical rigor and full-stack craftsmanship to create impactful, data-driven solutions.
